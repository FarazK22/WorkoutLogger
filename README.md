# My Personal Project

## A workout manager app

One of the pillars of my life has been my personal fitness journey and staying active with vigorous workout routines 
has become an integral part of my day-to-day life. With a variety of routines and exercises, I often find myself unable
to keep an accurate record of each workout I do and better monitor my progress on a finer scale. I often notice 
individuals in the gym carrying physical journals to log their workouts and keep track of their progress. Creating an 
application that can be integrated into our personal devices (phones, smart watches) could eliminate the need to carry
around extra material like journals and allow for a more efficient way to track progress and quantify the effects that
these workouts are having on an individual's physical performance.

The main purpose of this application is to act as a **personal fitness log** that users can use to keep track of their 
physical activity and monitor their progress. The application will allow for users to input their workouts by logging 
exercises done under **three categories**. The three categories are as follows:

- Strength-training
- Endurance-training
- Flexibility-training

Users will be able to input calories burnt per workout and add that information to their log. On a week-to-week basis,
users will be able to compare their logs and monitor for progress to note if they have improved or regressed.

This application is targeted to a wide variety of individuals who want to keep track of their exercise routines or 
fitness journeys. The app is meant to work as a personal fitness diary, so individuals from all walks of life who care 
enough about their fitness journeys will be able to use the app with relative ease.
